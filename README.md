The plan of approach is described in the: Plan_of_approach_week_4.pdf file

[w03-008] and [w03-009] are be added and working, however they do not work 
in conjunction with [w04-001] the autocomplete function. Since this has priority over the format and add pictures function.

sidenote: For the next time I will use a different folder for all the php files. 
	  They are used by both the blogger and the reader so do not need to be in both folders twice.
